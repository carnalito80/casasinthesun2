                                of the many Chiringuitos. Here you can also find chess to play and a big playground for children. During the summer months it's a lot of activity a long the beach walk with festivals, smaller concerts and every evening it's a market
                                here and various entertainments for children. 
                            </p>
                            <p>You can also find Mirador del Carmen a long the beach walk where you can visit an art exhibition in Sala Mirador del Carmen or you can go up to the 12th floor to enjoy a drink in Cielo Skybar or just watch the views.
                               In the harbor, you can see fishing boats, shop at the fish auction on certain days of the week, or simply sit and enjoy a good drink or meal at one of the restaurants or bars. There is also a market every Sunday where clothes, jewelry, 
                               handbags, toys, etc., are sold. Not far from the harbor you find the beach Playa del Cristo that is perfect for families since it is located in a bay and has shallow water.
