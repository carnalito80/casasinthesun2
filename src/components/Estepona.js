                            <p>Estepona or the Garden of Costa del Sol, has become very popular in recent years. It is a cozy, genuinely Spanish town located about 80 kilometers from Malaga with approximately 70,000 inhabitants. Estepona is 
                                located approximately 80 kilometers from Malaga and 50 kilometers from Gibraltar, so there are two airports within a reasonable distance. In the old town, you can stroll the narrow streets with white houses on either side. 
                                Flowers hang on the walls along most streets, often in the same type of pot throughout the entire street. Here, you will find many caf√©s, restaurants, bars and shopping opportunities.
                            </p>
                            <p>La Rada is a long sandy beach and stretches through the entire town. Here you can enjoy the a day in the sun, take a walk or jog, work out at one of the outdoor gyms, or grab something to eat or drink at one 
                                of the many Chiringuitos. Here you can also find chess to play and a big playground for children. During the summer months it's a lot of activity a long the beach walk with festivals, smaller concerts and every evening it's a market
                                here and various entertainments for children. 
                            </p>
                            <p>You can also find Mirador del Carmen a long the beach walk where you can visit an art exhibition in Sala Mirador del Carmen or you can go up to the 12th floor to enjoy a drink in Cielo Skybar or just watch the views.
                               In the harbor, you can see fishing boats, shop at the fish auction on certain days of the week, or simply sit and enjoy a good drink or meal at one of the restaurants or bars. There is also a market every Sunday where clothes, jewelry, 
                               handbags, toys, etc., are sold. Not far from the harbor you find the beach Playa del Cristo that is perfect for families since it is located in a bay and has shallow water.
